Exploring Data Breaches 

The target browser is a laptop/computer with screen size around 1280 x 1000

Description:
The API used is called Data Breaches from the postman open API database. 
https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v2/breaches

My project visualizes the data in a bar chart format with years on the x-axis
and number of breaches occuring on the y-axis. 

This visualization was created using the chart.js library. 

The CSS framework used was an edited version of our CSS file from lab 5. 
Modifications were made to change color and sizing of the chart and table 
created which display different aspects of the data. 

Overall the goal of this project is to make data breach incidents easier
to search and understand for a lay audience. It is also allowing the audience to 
analyze trends in the number of data breach incidents per year through seeing
the pattern in the bar chart being displayed.
